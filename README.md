What is it
This is the **vulkan** engine guided by https://www.youtube.com/@BrendanGalea 

You can use CMake to build but alse write a .bat for window user

you can exit .env.cmake to check whether you have the right path to the dependences.

Currently based on the libraries glm, GLFW, and tinyobjloader.
In the future, ImGui will also be incorporated to implement basic UI interfaces. There are plans to add ray tracing capabilities and achieve reflections.
